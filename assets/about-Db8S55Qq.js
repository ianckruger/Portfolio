 and freedom that Software Engineering has provided me since high school, throughout my time at the university 
I have developed a strong passion for Mobile App Engineering.`,pres_after:"I love to learn new skills by diving head first into projects I know nothing about. When I first wanted to get into machine learning, I tasked myself (and my now cofounder) with creating a live traffic flow detection program! This has since sprouted into an entire business focused on optimizing traffic flow, but I have made sure to hone my skills through university-funded research and various software engineering experiences."},i={src:"myself.png",alt:"A photo of me :)"},o={github:"https://github.com/ianckruger",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-kruger/",instagram:"https://www.instagram.com/iankruger_/"},r={title:e,description:t,pres:n,photo:i,links:o};export{r as default,t as description,o as links,i as photo,n as pres,e as title};
